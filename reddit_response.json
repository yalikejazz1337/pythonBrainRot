Rules still apply.\n\nWe did a deep dive into Rule 11 [a year ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f5yjn/aita_monthly_open_forum_march_2023_rule_11/) Back then, we were mostly focused on how this rule applies to romantic relationships. Based on user feedback and confusion, we thought we'd take this month to talk about one of the more frequently misunderstood aspects of the rule: Cutting Contact.\n\n\"Going no contact\" is such a frequent suggestion in 2024 that it's risen to meme status. Did your mother in law eat the last Oreo? Better go no contact with her! While many people think of \"cutting contact\" strictly in terms of the most extreme option- running off into the deep words to become a solitary forest hermit- it's a more nuanced issue on AITA.\n\nOur intention with Rule 11 has always boiled down to consent. You are free to choose the people you want in your life and we don't believe anyone should be able to call you The Asshole for removing yourself from a relationship that makes you unhappy. Be friends with whoever you want (or don\u2019t)! Date whoever you want (or don't)! We don't feel like our sub should arbitrate issues of consent.\n\nWhere this becomes tricky as far as cutting contact is concerned is dealing with the shades of gray and the severity. Distancing yourself from a toxic friendship, breaking up with a boyfriend, not allowing your father in law to meet your children - these are all examples of situations that would fall under rule 11. But what about smaller issues? Is giving your roommate the silent treatment included? What about refusing to attend your sister's wedding, or declining an invitation to a family reunion?\n\nIt all comes down to degree and duration. The \"silent treatment\" is generally short. Saying \"no thanks\" to an invitation is usually a one-time event. Rule 11 kicks in when the change is longer-lasting and significant;\nthe post wording, title choice and judgment bot response help us make the call.\n\nOur enforcement of Rule 11 hasn't changed at all, but we've fiddled with the text a bit to clarify the issues it includes. It now reads:\n\n___\n\nRule 11: No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\n\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\n* AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with \\**anyone** (or not)\n* AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\n* AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\n* Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\n* Posts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\n* Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\nAs always, if you see a post that violates this rule, please report it and we\u2019ll take a look!\n\n___\n\n#Please remember - no linking to posts in the monthly fourm!",

Had me (28M) and my three younger sisters (26, 25 and 23). Dad was having an affair for most of the marriage and had a daughter (25) with his affair partner. Two of my sisters knew dad's other daughter from school and had bad blood with her. Looking back it's clear to see she hated them for having dad when she didn't, because dad was never in her life. But the bad blood existed for years. When we learned of the affair and his other child it blew our family apart. The four of us sided with our mom and were disgusted by our dad. His other daughter was pissed about him not being around and after mom kicked him out she demanded he be a dad to her. So she moved in with him. But he did not want to be with her mom so that relationship ended entirely.\n\nMy parents hated each other afterward. Dad was pissed mom wouldn't stay with him. Mom was pissed he cheated and made a child with someone else. Mom was the better parent of the two and dad knew he would be alone in doing the work with his other daughter when mom wouldn't stay with him.\n\nDad tried to make the four of us a family with his other daughter. It didn't work that way. We knew her mom and had issues with her before we found out about the affair, so bad blood deepened because we hated her mom as much as we hated our dad. She's very defensive of that. But she was also hurt that we didn't want her, I think, and I think it was pretty obvious that we didn't want her to be our sister and didn't accept her.\n\nI do not have a relationship with my dad or his daughter. He will call me sometimes and I don't answer. But if I see him, and he knows where I work so it happens, I won't make a scene either. Anyway, I'm getting married. I did not invite my dad or his daughter. He apparently knew I was getting married and that invites were sent out via a family member. So he showed up at my work and decided to ask me about it since I didn't answer the phone to him. He told me their invites got lost in the mail and he wanted me to know so I could fix it and give them the details. The family member who told him about me getting married and the invites did not give him more exact info. He said he would hate to miss the wedding because he doesn't have his invite to RSVP. I told him their invites didn't get lost because they were never invited. He became angry and I started walking away. But he followed and told me he didn't deserve to be punished for cheating on mom when he was still our dad. He also said his daughter doesn't deserve to be on the outside. I told him neither of those things was my problem and he might be my dad by blood, but he was never a good one. He told me I'll regret shunning them one day.\n\nAITA?",

But he did not want to be with her mom so that relationship ended entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents hated each other afterward. Dad was pissed mom wouldn&amp;#39;t stay with him. Mom was pissed he cheated and made a child with someone else. Mom was the better parent of the two and dad knew he would be alone in doing the work with his other daughter when mom wouldn&amp;#39;t stay with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad tried to make the four of us a family with his other daughter. It didn&amp;#39;t work that way. We knew her mom and had issues with her before we found out about the affair, so bad blood deepened because we hated her mom as much as we hated our dad. She&amp;#39;s very defensive of that. But she was also hurt that we didn&amp;#39;t want her, I think, and I think it was pretty obvious that we didn&amp;#39;t want her to be our sister and didn&amp;#39;t accept her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not have a relationship with my dad or his daughter. He will call me sometimes and I don&amp;#39;t answer. But if I see him, and he knows where I work so it happens, I won&amp;#39;t make a scene either. Anyway, I&amp;#39;m getting married. I did not invite my dad or his daughter. He apparently knew I was getting married and that invites were sent out via a family member. So he showed up at my work and decided to ask me about it since I didn&amp;#39;t answer the phone to him. He told me their invites got lost in the mail and he wanted me to know so I could fix it and give them the details. The family member who told him about me getting married and the invites did not give him more exact info. He said he would hate to miss the wedding because he doesn&amp;#39;t have his invite to RSVP. I told him their invites didn&amp;#39;t get lost because they were never invited. He became angry and I started walking away. But he followed and told me he didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be punished for cheating on mom when he was still our dad. He also said his daughter doesn&amp;#39;t deserve to be on the outside. I told him neither of those things was my problem and he might be my dad by blood, but he was never a good one. He told me I&amp;#39;ll regret shunning them one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I agreed to it because I wanted her party to be special and she had no other option. I spent 9 hours straight cleaning my house top to bottom in preparation and even made edibles for the party.\n\nLast week I had to fly out for 5 days on a business trip. They ended up scheduling it on top of her birthday after I agreed to host it. I fought to rework the entire project schedule and got multiple other people to change plans just so I could be back in time for the day of her birthday and then the party the next day.\n\nThis trip turned out to be one of the most mentally taxing projects of my career. Both flights in and out were red eyes and the work required me to do everything late at night (as late as 6am on a few nights). I worked 62 hours and got average of 4 hours of sleep per night in a 5 day span. One night I only got 1 hour of sleep before working 12 hours. I stayed in sketchy hotels, got an eye infection, and even ran into my bipolar ex that emotional traumatized me. Needless to say I was drained mentally and physically.\n\nI took the day off after I got back so we could hang out on her actual birthday. She spent the entire week with her mom shopping and hanging out. We never agreed on a specific time or even plan on what we were doing. I woke up early to a work call to fix one last thing from the project, said good morning to my gf and we talked about getting coffee at some point. My body just couldn't physically stay awake anymore and I ended up falling asleep for more 3 hours.\n\nFinally I get up, get her some flowers, and head to her place to take her for her favorite lunch, see a movie she wanted, and get her favorite cake. When I got there, she was extremely upset and crying really hard because I slept to long. When I tried to explain, she dismissed my sleep deprivation because she doesn't get good sleep in general and said \"welcome to my life!\". She didn't thank me for the flowers, lunch, movie or cake.\n\nI felt like I have been giving 110% to everyone and everything and yet I'm still getting yelled at. It brought back feelings of never being good enough and walking on eggshells that my traumatizing ex gave me. She even told me later that negative reinforcement works better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I was assigned this randomn group project partner (20F) and we were working on a project for most of the semester.\n\nWe had decided to organize the project in a way that she would do core parts and I would do plug-in modules that depend on her core.\n\nHowever since she did her parts in a convoluted way, it was hard for me to understand it and when I couldn't get it to work she had to do them as well. We got into an argument and she claimed it wasn't convoluted.\n\nI then paid a tutor who advised me and said he could help but that the project would be easier to do in rust compared to c++. She agreed to redo the project in rust if I converted everything we had so far myself and she'd help out with the last part. We got permission from the prof to do it in rust instead. The tutor then helped me convert her code to rust and which counted as my part. \n\nHowever when it finally came to doing the last part she said she had no time to work with me on it as she didn't know rust well enough and had some ballet competition the weekend of the deadline. She offered to finish it in the C++ version but I told her it is OK. I then got it done with the help of the tutor and submitted the project.\n\nSince the rust code was all written by me in the statement of contribution I had to state that I did all the code and she contributed to the design process and report.\n\nHowever the prof took that as her not contributing as only the code is actually graded and decided to give her a 0 on the project which would lead to her failing the class as it is 70% of the grade. \n\nShe now wants me to come talk to the professor with her and is upset at me for refusing. The way I see it it is not really my problem and I don't want to face any trouble and she did already tell the prof that she had done the older c++ code we didn't submit.\n\nAITA here? She's pretty upset at me and seems to blame me when it is the profs decision.",

I was assigned this randomn group project partner (20F) and we were working on a project for most of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had decided to organize the project in a way that she would do core parts and I would do plug-in modules that depend on her core.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However since she did her parts in a convoluted way, it was hard for me to understand it and when I couldn&amp;#39;t get it to work she had to do them as well. We got into an argument and she claimed it wasn&amp;#39;t convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then paid a tutor who advised me and said he could help but that the project would be easier to do in rust compared to c++. She agreed to redo the project in rust if I converted everything we had so far myself and she&amp;#39;d help out with the last part. We got permission from the prof to do it in rust instead. The tutor then helped me convert her code to rust and which counted as my part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However when it finally came to doing the last part she said she had no time to work with me on it as she didn&amp;#39;t know rust well enough and had some ballet competition the weekend of the deadline. She offered to finish it in the C++ version but I told her it is OK. I then got it done with the help of the tutor and submitted the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the rust code was all written by me in the statement of contribution I had to state that I did all the code and she contributed to the design process and report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However the prof took that as her not contributing as only the code is actually graded and decided to give her a 0 on the project which would lead to her failing the class as it is 70% of the grade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She now wants me to come talk to the professor with her and is upset at me for refusing. The way I see it it is not really my problem and I don&amp;#39;t want to face any trouble and she did already tell the prof that she had done the older c++ code we didn&amp;#39;t submit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA here? She&amp;#39;s pretty upset at me and seems to blame me when it is the profs decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I loved this guy and he spoiled me to pieces. It was a constant joke that the only reason he married my aunt was so I'd officially be his niece. He was ecstatic when my aunt Sarah became pregnant because being a dad was something that he always wanted and adored my cousin \"Julie\" (24f) for the first few years of her life. Then one day while Bill was out of town, I was sleeping over and in the middle of the night I woke up to use the bathroom and heard the backdoor slam (it had a very distinct sound) I was curious and peeked out the window  from the room that I was in that was overlooking the backyard. There was a man there talking to my aunt, laughing and hugging before we went away and the way that he left was not circling around to the front where the other cars would be going over the fence and I thought that was weird. I went back to sleep and when I woke up Bill was back and without thinking I mentioned what I saw during breakfast. Sarah tried playing it off but she was weird about it. Unfortunately, that began an avalanche of mess and not only did it come out that Sarah was having an affair and Julie wasn't his, but my mom and (maternal) grandparents knew and said nothing. \n\nThere was a divorce and while Bill let Sarah have the house he knew she couldn't afford to maintain it, left the country (he had dual citizenship), and never tried to stay in contact with Julie. It was heartbreaking, I missed Bill and I was sad for my cousin so I became a target for her and Sarah's anger. In their mind, if I hadn't of said anything Bill would've stayed. I felt so guilty about it for years that I accepted their acts of wrath in silence but when Julie hacked my email to reject my offer of admissions to my dream college and two scholarships, I just couldn't take it anymore. \n\nThere was a huge blowout between my mom and Sarah we've all beeb VLC since. Fast forward 2020 and I happen to see Bill on social media and I shoot him a message. Ironically, I was surprised that he responded and he asked about my life. We would talk for a while after that but never once brought up Julie or Sarah. Bill never married and found out he couldn't have bio kids and I knew that was tough for him. \n\nUnfortunately, Bill has passed away. I went to the funeral in secret just to pay my respects and then went back home. I expected nothing so I was surprised when Bill's lawyer called and told me that I was left an inheritance. I was surprised and so was Bill's ex girlfriend because she tracked me down on social media and put me on blast where all of my extended family could see and word got back to Sarah and Julie. They think that I'm a witch and my grandparents want me to split it to keep the peace but I kinda don't want to given how they treated me AITA?  ",

Our 13 y/o son, Monroe, started going to a Methodist church last fall (2023), none of our other kids are Christian or religious in any other way.\r  \n\r  \nMonroe has a friend, Wyatt (13M) from his youth group. Wyatt is a very smart kid and Monroe and him are close friends.\r  \n\r  \nWyatt is openly gay, he\u2019s also autistic and has an interest in fashion.

Wyatt has gone to Monroe\u2019s baseball games and their friendship is good overall.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Wyatt can sometimes be rude. The last instance happened last week. In Wyatt\u2019s school, they take written tests at the end of each unit in P.E. class, Monroe was helping Wyatt study when our 13 y/o daughter (and Monroe\u2019s twin), Makayla came in and asked Wyatt for advice on a dress she found. Wyatt told her the dress didn\u2019t go with her eyes and made other comments about why he didn\u2019t think it looked good on her. This made Makayla upset and she went to my husband and me.\r  \n\r  \nI was upset and asked Wyatt to apologize and he said he didn\u2019t understand why he had to, Monroe was defending him and when I asked my husband for backup, he said he wanted to talk about it first.\r  \n\r  \nWe talked later that night and my husband told me I was overreacting and that Wyatt can\u2019t lie because of his autism and it would be wrong to make an autistic kid tell a white lie. I said this would just make Wyatt have poor manners.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday, Monroe asked me if he could go to Wyatt\u2019s house for Easter next Sunday. I told him no because Wyatt has poor manners. My husband got home later that night and Monroe told him what happened. He was upset at me and told Monroe he could go to Wyatt\u2019s house.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband accused me of being ablest and said I needed to learn to accept Wyatt for who he is. I told him I had no problem with autistic kids, just rude kids but he told me that I was being ridiculous. AITA?",

After a couple of years we started to question if mom was having an affair. Our dad suspected she might be. It was a big conflict in our parents marriage. Maybe it wasn't a full blown affair. But even dad suggested if it wasn't a physical affair, it was an emotional one and I tend to agree. Mom and Mark would get very flirty with each other and she invited him to everything as a family friend/family. My dad and Mark did not get along and Mark used to tease dad that he was so uptight and possessive to be so bothered by harmless flirting. Mom would fight to have Mark included in stuff because dad didn't want him around. Our parents marriage was never the same. They even separated for a while but got back together.\n\nWhen I was 19 my dad passed away from a brain aneurism. Mark was at the house right after it happened and mom even had him sit with us during the funeral. She told us he was her best friend despite the fact her other best friend, someone we all loved, was not asked to sit with us. This was my mom's lifelong friend Abby. Abby claimed mom saw Mark as a brother.\n\nTwo years later mom announced she and Mark were a couple. It didn't come as a surprise but my sister and I didn't really like or truly support the relationship. We said nothing. But mom picked up on it. She noticed it more apparently when they got married 18 months later. Now they have been married for almost 3 years. And the whole thing became a heated debate because my sister is getting married and really hasn't included mom in anything wedding related and has made it very clear when asked that Mark has no role in her wedding at all. This led mom to confront my sister about the change in relationship and my sister told her she just sees her relationship with Mark as proof that they were never just friends with a sibling bond. She said people don't date people they have a \"close sibling relationship with\". My sister told her she didn't believe they never had an affair and she basically showed dad disrespect by getting with Mark. She said moving on with anyone else would have been different. But Mark was a slap in the face to our dad.\n\nMy mom came to me after her fight with my sister and told me my sister had made accusations against her and Mark and especially her and she wanted to know if I thought the same thing of her. I said yes. I told her I wasn't entirely convinced she and Mark had a physical affair. But I refused to believe it was not an emotional one and it did change how I saw her and did make me feel not great about her marriage and current relationship with Mark.\n\nMy mom said it was an awful thing to accuse her of and how could both of us have such a low opinion of her when she was a great wife to dad and a good mom to us. She told me she hated that I support my sister's accusations when the two of us used to be so close. AITA?",

They had known each other/were dating for a year prior to that. My mom died 7 years ago. Gwen's ex took off when she was pregnant with her son and neither kid knows him or has memories of him.\n\nGwen's kids are not my siblings. I do not love them or feel the same big brother protectiveness. My relationship with them is very different than the one with my actual siblings. When we were younger I used to let them crawl into my bed if they had a nightmare and dad was working nights and we had a babysitter. I would still let them sleep on the floor of my room if they wanted to for some reason. My brother did it once in the last year because he was being bullied at school. I hug my siblings and I will ruffle their hair and stuff. But I don't do those things with my stepsiblings and I wouldn't be comfortable with physical affection toward them. I speak to them. I won't leave the room or refuse to let them join me if I'm watching something. But I'm not going to cuddle them on the couch (which they have asked) and I don't play with them in my spare time.\n\nThe kids have felt less loved because of this so my dad and Gwen wanted the three of us to talk things through in therapy. They said I have four siblings now and not just two and all four should be treated the same. I told them it wasn't going to happen because I don't love my stepsiblings or feel comfortable being that close to them or showing them affection. I said I will be nice, I won't ignore them or be mean to them. But that my relationship with my actual siblings is always going to be different to whatever develops between us in the future. Gwen snapped that I should say siblings for all four instead of saying stepsiblings. I told her they are siblings and I don't think I'll ever think of them as actual siblings. She asked what about her and where she fits in. I said she's my dad's wife. Then she was like \"so I won't be mentioned as your parent when you graduate\" and I said no.\n\nThe conversation turned to Gwen not wanting her kids around such different treatment and discussions of if I should leave. The therapist was like woah, stop talking like that, but they ignored the therapist and continued to discuss this in therapy, in front of us. When the therapist told them we should be figuring out ways to live together with less hurt feelings, and she mentioned talking to Gwen's kids, Gwen said she didn't want me in the house and dad said he understood. So I said dad could send me somewhere else if he wants and I won't fight that. Dad was pissed off that I would prefer him to send me away than embrace Gwen and the kids as my real family. He told me it's not what mom would have wanted and she would be ashamed of me. I pointed out mom never had a close relationship with her step relatives either and saw them differently to her real family.\n\nAITA?",

We are fortunately able to put it off until this April to give her more time to grow. My mother has been very much in the loop of this timeline and known since Christmas time that her surgery would be in April. \n\nIn march, she randomly called me up saying she was going to fly down and visit us in April with her longtime boyfriend. I reminded her our daughter will be having surgery around then and that it\u2019s important she\u2019s not exposed to extra germs and etc. She casually tells me that she already bought tickets and tells me she\u2019ll here here between x and y dates. I was not asked, I was told. \n\nI should clarify that they are strictly coming to visit, not help out with my other kids during my daughter\u2019s surgery. She wants to visit the beach, go to the aquarium, etc while they\u2019re here. I\u2019m expected to play hostess. I was annoyed af at this point, but let it roll off my shoulders. If she happens to be here when her surgery is taking place (and the 1+ weeks she\u2019ll be inpatient afterwards recovering) her loss. Im absolutely not leaving my daughter\u2019s side and it\u2019s her wasted trip. \n\nYesterday, I get a text from my grandpa (also not local) stating he\u2019ll be coming down that week too along with two other aunts for my mom\u2019s wedding. I was completely blindsided by this wedding. I was informed that my aunts will all be meeting up at my home on specific dates/times related to wedding stuff. Have I mentioned my daughter is having OPEN HEART SURGERY during that time? I texted my mom for clarification and she laughed it off saying \u201coh yeah, I forgot to tell you we decided to get married while we\u2019re down there.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m livid at this point. Livid that I found out through my grandpa, and that I wasn\u2019t asked first. Livid that my mom is putting my daughters health at risk by trying to expose her immunocompromised self to a ton of new people right before a life-threatening surgery. Livid that at no point did she stop to think that I might just want to focus on my daughter and the fact that they are stopping her heart that week instead of a stupid wedding that was planned last minute. \n\nWIBTA for calling my mom out? I guess I really just want her to know how hurt I am that she\u2019s valuing her trip and wedding more than my daughter\u2019s health and my own struggles. I\u2019ve literally never felt more unimportant to her than I do now. She just literally doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit about what we\u2019re all going through, and I want her to know it for no other reason than I just want to be heard. At the same time, another part of me just wants to bite my tongue and not ruin her day. ",

We are fortunately able to put it off until this April to give her more time to grow. My mother has been very much in the loop of this timeline and known since Christmas time that her surgery would be in April. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In march, she randomly called me up saying she was going to fly down and visit us in April with her longtime boyfriend. I reminded her our daughter will be having surgery around then and that it\u2019s important she\u2019s not exposed to extra germs and etc. She casually tells me that she already bought tickets and tells me she\u2019ll here here between x and y dates. I was not asked, I was told. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should clarify that they are strictly coming to visit, not help out with my other kids during my daughter\u2019s surgery. She wants to visit the beach, go to the aquarium, etc while they\u2019re here. I\u2019m expected to play hostess. I was annoyed af at this point, but let it roll off my shoulders. If she happens to be here when her surgery is taking place (and the 1+ weeks she\u2019ll be inpatient afterwards recovering) her loss. Im absolutely not leaving my daughter\u2019s side and it\u2019s her wasted trip. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I get a text from my grandpa (also not local) stating he\u2019ll be coming down that week too along with two other aunts for my mom\u2019s wedding. I was completely blindsided by this wedding. I was informed that my aunts will all be meeting up at my home on specific dates/times related to wedding stuff. Have I mentioned my daughter is having OPEN HEART SURGERY during that time? I texted my mom for clarification and she laughed it off saying \u201coh yeah, I forgot to tell you we decided to get married while we\u2019re down there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m livid at this point. Livid that I found out through my grandpa, and that I wasn\u2019t asked first. Livid that my mom is putting my daughters health at risk by trying to expose her immunocompromised self to a ton of new people right before a life-threatening surgery. Livid that at no point did she stop to think that I might just want to focus on my daughter and the fact that they are stopping her heart that week instead of a stupid wedding that was planned last minute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WIBTA for calling my mom out? I guess I really just want her to know how hurt I am that she\u2019s valuing her trip and wedding more than my daughter\u2019s health and my own struggles. I\u2019ve literally never felt more unimportant to her than I do now. She just literally doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit about what we\u2019re all going through, and I want her to know it for no other reason than I just want to be heard. At the same time, another part of me just wants to bite my tongue and not ruin her day. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am child free by choice and parents like this are so rude. It\u2019s like the world revolves around their kids, and how dare I put my old dog in a stroller. Strollers are for kids only! \n\nSo I told her to F off and get out of my way and pushed the stroller forward to move on. She then starts yelling how dare i cuss in front of her kids.

She\u2019s having joint issues, so when we take her on a city trip, we put her in a dog stroller so we can walk around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we were navigating a busy sidewalk and this woman, her friend, and their kids, there were at least 4 kids\u2014this woman points at our dog in the stroller and says \u201coh hell no.\u201d She starts laughing, pulls her friend over, and they and their kids surround the stroller. The woman goes \u201care you for real? This is not a child. These are children.\u201d Pointing at her kids. As if I was cosplaying a parent by having my dog in a stroller. I am child free by choice and parents like this are so rude. It\u2019s like the world revolves around their kids, and how dare I put my old dog in a stroller. Strollers are for kids only! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I told her to F off and get out of my way and pushed the stroller forward to move on. She then starts yelling how dare i cuss in front of her kids. I kept walking and she left us alone, but it ruined my day and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I think she\u2019s an asshole, but was I wrong to \u201cswear\u201d in front of her kids? I was pissed off. I don\u2019t want to be rude in front of kids, though.

SIL was like hang on a minute, that's not what you're supposed to say. I was like what do you mean. She said she expected me to be on her side.

My stepsister is kind of annoying but we get along I think,  My step brother on the other hand is just a straight up fuckwad, like he doesn't bully me or anything he is just openly rude, passive aggressive, sometimes too physical with me, and teases me over everything I do.  My mom and step dad work a lot and they leave my step brother in charge of me and my step sister most of the time.\n\nHe gets SUPER power hungry when left in charge, for example he will full on grab the remote out of my hand if im watching TV and yell that hes in charge so I can't fight back.  If I bring friends over he kicks them out.  The worst is when he tries to police what time ill be home from school, I take the train home and he picks his sister up from her middle school.  If im not home maybe 10 minutes after then he spam calls me and basically yells at me to come home.  Anytime I bitch about it to my mom she just tells me to not cause any fighting and to let it go.\n\nYesterday around 12 I wanted to go get a snack at the store that is right down the street and asked if my step sister wanted to come with me.  I go there by myself all the time so I thought it would be no big deal, my step brother was not having it tho.  Right before we left out the front door he practically yelled at us to get back inside and how we aren't \"allowed\" to leave.  My step sister agreed right away and went back to our room but I wasn't having it.  After like 5 minutes of arguing he \"ordered\" me to go back to my room like his sister and I said \"She HAS to listen to you but you're not my brother so.........\" I then ran out the front door cause I knew that he couldn't keep up with me cause I'm faster.  I came back like 15 minutes later and he didn't really interact or have much expressions when I came in.Later that night tho my mom was FURIOUS at me for going against his orders, I tried to say that he's power mad but she said that she doesn't care and they left him in charge for a reason.  I am not grounded for a week and even my step sister is saying I was out of line to try and fight his rules.  AITA?\n\nEDIT:I am 15 not 17, sorry should've clarified ",

We have all lived together for about a year and I have lived with Ariel for about 3 years now.  I am in school and I work full time (40-60 hour work weeks) my boyfriend is not in school but has a manual labor job that he travels for and works 12-16 hours day. Ariel is a part-time student.Last year her parents told her she needed to get a job since they couldn't afford to keep paying for her living expenses. Long story short I had to drive her to the hospital because the stress became too much for her, after a hospital stay and lots of crying phone calls her parents agreed to keep paying for her but she's not getting as much and they are just covering essentials and no longer giving her any extra money. The agreement they had after this was that they cut her off after she graduates.\n\nOver the last summer break, my workplace was hiring temp workers for 2 weeks since there was a big move to a different facility and they needed more hands. The pay was $22 hr for just walking a cart full of boxes down a hallway from one person to another. I asked Ariel if she was interested and wanted to make some extra money since she had been complaining that she was broke. She said yes and I got her in touch with that manager and she took the job for the 2 weeks. On the first day, she was going to catch a ride in with me to work in the morning. 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave she was still not out of her room. I asked her if she was coming and she just started crying saying that it was too much and she couldn't do it today and asked me to call her manager and tell him she wasn't coming. I told her she had to do it since it was not my job.\n\nThis continued every day she was supposed to work. It got to the point that the manager reached out to me to know if she was ever going to show up after 6 days of no-call no-show, I had to tell him it's very unlikely that she will. Let's just say this has left a bad taste in my mouth about her work ethic. My boyfriend and I have started thinking about moving into a place with just the 2 of us, part of the reason we haven't committed to a place is because we love this apartment, rent is decent, it is close to both our jobs, and the amenities are hard to find unless you triple the rent. I am worried that once she graduates and her parents cut her off it's going to be the same song and dance as the last few times she's had to get a job, and she thinks that my boyfriend and I will cover her share of bills until she finds a job.  \n\nI'm worried about signing another year's lease with her since the lease would extend past when she graduates and her parents cut her off. I do not want to be taken advantage of here, WIBTA if I told her that? I won't keep funding her so she can keep living with us.\n\nTDLR: My roommate doesn't work, and doesn't want to work. When her parents cut her off I'm moving out.",

She consumer a lot of far-right news, anti-vax, government conspiracies, etc.  I\u2019m pretty LC with her, and have gone through periods of NC with her because of her gaslighting, rewriting history. \n\nMy son (16M) and I (43F) were supposed to go and visit my aunt Cindy (55F) this weekend, about six hours away. She was diagnosed last month with stage 4 bone and lung cancer and it has devastated our family.  My mom likes to visit Cindy as well.  However, Barb has a habit of relying on others for rides, which often results in prolonged stays at Cindy's house. Three weeks ago, during a drive with Barb, I asked her to share driving duties for an hour so I could rest. To my surprise, she refused, citing sudden fatigue and refusing to let my son drive. This left me frustrated and exhausted as I had to drive the entire way without a break.\n\nNow, Barb and I each separately planned on going up to visit Cindy and the boys. When bard found out I was going up the same day she said Oh that\u2019s great!  Can I ride with you?  I said No, I think it\u2019s best if you take your car as planned and I take my car. That way we will both have our cars and you can leave whenever you need to. She didn\u2019t like that answer and pressed me for more. I told her that she didn\u2019t help with driving last time, and she wouldn\u2019t let my son drive either. She should take her car as planned. She was very angry with me, asked why I hated her so much, and finally yelled that she was sorry that I had such a B for a mother. It was a weird conversation but I felt proud that I had been true to my boundaries. \n\nThat night Cindy called me. She sounded so weak and sick, and told me that she was shocked that I said no to my mom. I apologized for her having any stress of this to deal with, and that I didn\u2019t owe my mom a ride. She was going to drive up on her own and she still can. Cindy said that because of the stress I had caused, that I shouldn\u2019t visit her. I was devastated. Being stage 4, she doesn\u2019t have long, and this trip was planned back before we even knew about the cancer. \n\nbarb said I was acting hateful and that I should post this on Reddit so I would know just how horrible I was being. I said she should stop involving Cindy in our arguments, and she should stop being a freeloader. \n\nAunt Cindy called me later SCREAMING at me. That I am horrible, what kind of person wouldn\u2019t give a ride to their own mother, that I am selfish, manipulative and mean, and that my deceased grandmother would be so disappointed in me.  \n\nI am crushed. I feel like I am allowed to not have to drive someone that I don\u2019t want to, especially if that person has previously been a terrible passenger, they are perfectly able to drive themselves, and their car is working fine. \n\nSo Reddit, let me have it. Am I the worst daughter ever?  Or was it ok to say no?\n",

She consumer a lot of far-right news, anti-vax, government conspiracies, etc.  I\u2019m pretty LC with her, and have gone through periods of NC with her because of her gaslighting, rewriting history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My son (16M) and I (43F) were supposed to go and visit my aunt Cindy (55F) this weekend, about six hours away. She was diagnosed last month with stage 4 bone and lung cancer and it has devastated our family.  My mom likes to visit Cindy as well.  However, Barb has a habit of relying on others for rides, which often results in prolonged stays at Cindy&amp;#39;s house. Three weeks ago, during a drive with Barb, I asked her to share driving duties for an hour so I could rest. To my surprise, she refused, citing sudden fatigue and refusing to let my son drive. This left me frustrated and exhausted as I had to drive the entire way without a break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Barb and I each separately planned on going up to visit Cindy and the boys. When bard found out I was going up the same day she said Oh that\u2019s great!  Can I ride with you?  I said No, I think it\u2019s best if you take your car as planned and I take my car. That way we will both have our cars and you can leave whenever you need to. She didn\u2019t like that answer and pressed me for more. I told her that she didn\u2019t help with driving last time, and she wouldn\u2019t let my son drive either. She should take her car as planned. She was very angry with me, asked why I hated her so much, and finally yelled that she was sorry that I had such a B for a mother. It was a weird conversation but I felt proud that I had been true to my boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night Cindy called me. She sounded so weak and sick, and told me that she was shocked that I said no to my mom. I apologized for her having any stress of this to deal with, and that I didn\u2019t owe my mom a ride. She was going to drive up on her own and she still can. Cindy said that because of the stress I had caused, that I shouldn\u2019t visit her. I was devastated. Being stage 4, she doesn\u2019t have long, and this trip was planned back before we even knew about the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;barb said I was acting hateful and that I should post this on Reddit so I would know just how horrible I was being. I said she should stop involving Cindy in our arguments, and she should stop being a freeloader. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt Cindy called me later SCREAMING at me. That I am horrible, what kind of person wouldn\u2019t give a ride to their own mother, that I am selfish, manipulative and mean, and that my deceased grandmother would be so disappointed in me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am crushed. I feel like I am allowed to not have to drive someone that I don\u2019t want to, especially if that person has previously been a terrible passenger, they are perfectly able to drive themselves, and their car is working fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Reddit, let me have it. Am I the worst daughter ever?  Or was it ok to say no?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

For background purposes, Annabel has next to no contact with her bio mother. She left when Annabel was two, and apart from the occasional birthday card, there\u2019s no contact there.\n\nI\u2019ve known Annabel since she was nine, and we had a good relationship, especially in the absence of a maternal figure in her life. I never had children of my own and never intended to, but was surprised that I was fine with being in a relationship with someone with a child.\n\nJames, Annabel, and I lived together for four years in what you could consider the \u201cnormal\u201d nuclear family. However, my relationship with James just got more and more strained. We were constantly arguing and bickering about really pointless things and the atmosphere in the house was sour. Annabel could tell and she became more withdrawn. Eventually, I told James I was leaving because I wasn\u2019t happy in the house or the relationship. He was livid, swearing and shouting, saying that he didn\u2019t want to see me again. I left and went to live with my sister until I found somewhere of my own.\n\nThis happened about three months ago, and I haven\u2019t had any contact with James since then, other than to collect some things from the house. I asked how Annabel was, and he said she was fine, but didn\u2019t really expand upon that. \n\nHowever, last week, I received an angry call from James saying how selfish and immature I\u2019d been my not getting Annabel a birthday present. I knew it was her birthday but decided not to and haven\u2019t tried to maintain a relationship with her because of the tension with James. James said how upset she was and that he couldn\u2019t believe I put relationship issues over a 13 year old girl, who I knew didn\u2019t have a mother. I told him he was being ridiculous and that if he wanted to cut me out of his life completely, that includes his daughter.\n\nHe said I was an asshole and a small gift or card would have meant the world to Annabel, before hanging up the phone. \n\nI sent Annabel a happy birthday text (the day after her birthday as the call was late), but she hasn\u2019t responded.\n\nAITA?",

He had a daughter, Annabel (F13) from a previous marriage. For background purposes, Annabel has next to no contact with her bio mother. She left when Annabel was two, and apart from the occasional birthday card, there\u2019s no contact there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve known Annabel since she was nine, and we had a good relationship, especially in the absence of a maternal figure in her life. I never had children of my own and never intended to, but was surprised that I was fine with being in a relationship with someone with a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James, Annabel, and I lived together for four years in what you could consider the \u201cnormal\u201d nuclear family. However, my relationship with James just got more and more strained. We were constantly arguing and bickering about really pointless things and the atmosphere in the house was sour. Annabel could tell and she became more withdrawn. Eventually, I told James I was leaving because I wasn\u2019t happy in the house or the relationship. He was livid, swearing and shouting, saying that he didn\u2019t want to see me again. I left and went to live with my sister until I found somewhere of my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened about three months ago, and I haven\u2019t had any contact with James since then, other than to collect some things from the house. I asked how Annabel was, and he said she was fine, but didn\u2019t really expand upon that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, last week, I received an angry call from James saying how selfish and immature I\u2019d been my not getting Annabel a birthday present. I knew it was her birthday but decided not to and haven\u2019t tried to maintain a relationship with her because of the tension with James. James said how upset she was and that he couldn\u2019t believe I put relationship issues over a 13 year old girl, who I knew didn\u2019t have a mother. I told him he was being ridiculous and that if he wanted to cut me out of his life completely, that includes his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said I was an asshole and a small gift or card would have meant the world to Annabel, before hanging up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent Annabel a happy birthday text (the day after her birthday as the call was late), but she hasn\u2019t responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

About a week before my birthday they start planning a party for me and even got my mom in on it. I love my one cat to death and they even got a custom cake of him. On my birthday I really wanted to see my cat and hometown friends so I decided to drive home. About 30 minutes into my 90 minute drive I find out they were throwing a surprise party and I wasn\u2019t going to turn around. I was very clear to them I wanted NOTHING for my birthday. My friends didn\u2019t spend any money on the party.(since they reached out to my mom who offered to pay for everything).

In the weeks leading up to my birthday, I stressed that I do NOT want anything for my birthday and would be upset if they did anything for me. About a week before my birthday they start planning a party for me and even got my mom in on it. I love my one cat to death and they even got a custom cake of him. On my birthday I really wanted to see my cat and hometown friends so I decided to drive home. About 30 minutes into my 90 minute drive I find out they were throwing a surprise party and I wasn\u2019t going to turn around. I was very clear to them I wanted NOTHING for my birthday. My friends didn\u2019t spend any money on the party.(since they reached out to my mom who offered to pay for everything).

Part of her plan is for all six of her bridesmaids to wear the same dress in the same color, and we knew that going in to shop with her at a boutique. Unfortunately, the other five are much smaller than I am, so picking out a dress that fit us all became an issue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe all tried on her favorite dress at the end, and it took me a long time to get it on. Outside I could hear her squealing with happiness as everyone else walked out of their rooms, and saying things like \"This is the one!\" with her friends hyping it up. But not only is it a horrible pale color that makes me look sick, it's unflattering to the point where I have massive rolls in the back and look pregnant in the front, especially with shape wear, which just bulges everything out across my hips and pinches the fabric up the sides. I also can't move well in it, and can't raise my arms more than halfway.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI tried to talk to Lisa about finding a similar dress that could work better for my body type, but she and the other bridesmaids insisted that this was the perfect color and dress. Lisa was dead set on everyone matching exactly and seemed locked in on it, so we ended up (quietly) arguing in the store in front of our mom and the sales associate who came to check on us. They tried to calm things down by saying the dress looked fine and everyone matched nicely, but it was pretty clear they were just trying to keep the peace. When I asked the sales associate, \"Does this dress looks fine *on me?*\"  her face turned red and she started talking about how it was important to honor Lisa's wishes on her special day, and at that point I hurried up to change and left. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince then, Lisa and I haven't talked, while both my parents insist that I need to suck it up and do what Lisa wants for her wedding, while also relaying that she's been really upset about this issue, but I have been as well.

Her breaks are less responsive than my car and it was sketchy the last time I drove it. She drives this daily so she\u2019s used to it. \n\nLong story short, she was very upset that I wouldn\u2019t drive her to work because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it. It would essentially mean 3hrs and 45min of driving in heavy snow to and from her work instead of her driving 2hrs because of the conditions. She says her anxiety while driving is also why she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable but I told her you should only be driving slow anyway and try to be relaxed while driving. \n\nAm I the asshole for not agreeing?",
