# Brain Rot generator with python
This project ended up being much easier than expected. This is a simple program, that get's a random post from a subreddit of the user's choice, using the requests library,
takes a background video that the user provides, cut a small portion of it out using moviePY, then using ttsx3, adds a text to speech version of the reddit post over the video.
